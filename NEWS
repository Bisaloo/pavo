------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW FUNCTIONS

* merge.rspec() combines rspec objects in a single object
* subset() class methods for rspec, vismodel and tcs
* summary() method for vismodel, returns attributes used in visual model

VISUAL MODEL

* vismodel() output includes only Qi or fi (as selected by qcatch argument)
* vismodel() accepts a scale parameter (multiplies iluminant in order to make it in flux units)
* vismodel() von Kries correction is now an optional argument
* coldist() includes option for receptor noise calculation
* coldist() subset argument for partial filtering
* Updated sensitivity curves

MINOR FEATURES

* getspec() works with Avasoft 8 output
* sensmodel() accepts user-defined ocular media transmission
* voloverlap() allows greater user control of plotting options
* voloverlap() includes Monte Carlo option for overlap calculation comparison
* as.rspec() accepts "whichwl" argument for user-defined wavelength column selection
* as.rspec() includes "interp" argument; updated automatic search for wavelength column
* aggspec() aggregates spectra by multiple vectors (e.g. average spectra by species and sex using by=list(species,sex) )
* peakshape() gives plot titles, allows ask=TRUE and mfrow

BUG FIXES

* explorespec() "free" argument fixed
* summary.rspec() S5 variable fixed; segments now divided by B1 (brightness-independent measure of saturation)
* summary.rspec() checks for positive values when bmaxneg is caluclated, returns NA
* tcs() accepts "v" cone class
* aggspec() fixed matching of names
* procspec() works with rspec objects that include a single reflectance spectrum
* peakshape() minor fixes
* aggplot() allows control for different line types per spectra
* voloverlap() now assigns darkgrey color for overlap if color vector is of length 1 or 2
