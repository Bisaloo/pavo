This release fixes a bug detected in the previous version. I apologize for not addressing the notes you noted, as some of them didn't show up on my check (I believe I was using an older version). I apologize for overlooking this on the previous submission.

I have ran cran check on my local OSX install and win builder and I don't see any NOTES anymore. Thanks for the help.

Regards,
Rafael Maia
