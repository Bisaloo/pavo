## Stuff to do
- add ability to use `explorespec` with factors
- make better labeling of spectra in `type=stack`, giver user control for labeling
- bug fix
- add ability to set limits in `summary` and other functions
- return warnings in `peakshape` if (1) one of the peak boundaries is at either 300 or 700 nm, (2) the ratio of the two halves of the peak is >>1; also, it would be nice to be able to specify unique boundaries in this case.. (how??)
- maybe `peakshape` can be interactive? i.e., plot it out, wait for user input (click, fix bounds, etc.), then record the data in an output dataset
- add couple plotting options for `segclass` objects
- reformat & extend vignette
+ subset.rspec doesn't work

## Me
+ Make fast `getspec` function
- make `lines.rspec`
- add ability to produce heatmap plot with `varying` vector in non-ascending order
+ add ability to add arguments to `aggspec` (e.g., `na.rm=TRUE`)
- need to make default color for points (it's transp now)
+ add ability to set `alpha` in `spec2rgb`
- give few options to calculate rgb values from specs (normalize, don't normalize)?
+ `subset.rspec` isn't working right. fix it so that 'wl' column is removed prior to subsetting.

## Raf
+ deprecate tcs class, have general `colspace` class
+ don't load `rgl` automatically

## Tom
+ Add color hexagon space & plot
+ Add maxwell triangle space & plot
+ Add categorical model space & plot
+ Add dichromat space & plot
+ Add color opponent coding (coc) space & plot
+ Add CIEXYZ space & plot
+ Generalise summary.colorspace
+ Add new visual systems: canis (dichromat), apis (trichromat), musca (housefly - tetra)
+ Generalise 'vismodel' doc
+ Add .jazirrad capability to getspec()
+ Add hyperbolic transform of quantum catches as an option in vismodel()
+ Add general 'colspace' function.
+ Add general plot.colspace function. The main workflow is now vismodel() -> colspace() -> plot().
+ Add general points.colspace & vol.colspace functions.
+ Generalise coldist. Coldist now also accepts colorspace objects from 'hexagon', 'cielab', and 'coc' spaces and returns appropriate distances.
+ fly vis syst
+ CIELAB space & plot
- cielab results seem off
- CIELCh space & plot?
