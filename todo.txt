# pavo roadmap

## Me
- add CIE chromaticity diagram
- make fast `getspec` function
- make `lines.rspec`


## Raf


## Stuff to do
- add ability to use `explorespec` with factors
- make better labeling of spectra in `type=stack`, giver user control for labeling
- deprecate tcs class, have general `colspace` class
- add ability to produce static 3d plots (scatter3d, ..)
- don't load `rgl` automatically
- add dichromatic chromaticity diagrams
- add hexagon chromaticity diagram
- add ability to add argugments to `aggspec` (e.g., `na.rm=TRUE`)
- bug fix
- add ability to produce heatmap plot with `varying` vector in non-ascending order
- add ability to set limits in `summary` and other functions
- return warnings in `peakshape` if (1) one of the peak boundaries is at either 300 or 700 nm, (2) the ratio of the two halves of the peak is >>1; also, it would be nice to be able to specify unique boundaries in this case.. (how??)
- maybe `peakshape` can be interactive? i.e., plot it out, wait for user input (click, fix bounds, etc.), then record the data in an output dataset
- add couple plotting options for `segclass` objects

## Notes
- so, would visual model object have coordinate data? what about hue.theta, hue.phi, etc.?
