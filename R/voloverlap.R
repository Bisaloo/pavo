#' Color volume overlap
#'
#' Calculates the overlap between the volumes defined by two sets of points in cartesian
#' space
#'
#' @export
#' @param tcsres1,tcsres2 (required) data frame, possibly a result from the \code{tcs} 
#' function, containing
#' values for the 'x', 'y' and 'z' coordinates as columns (labeled as such)
#' @param plot logical. Should the volumes and points be plotted? (defaults to \code{FALSE})
#' @param col a vector of length 3 with the colors for (in order) the first volume, 
#' the second volume, and the overlap.
#' @param new logical. Should a new plot window be called? If \code{FALSE}, volumes and their
#' overlap are plotted over the current plot (defaults to \code{TRUE}).
#' @return Calculates the overlap between the volumes defined by two set of points in
#' colorspace. The volume from the overlap is then given relative to:
#' \itemize{
#'	\item \code{vsmallest} the volume of the overlap divided by the smallest of that defined 
#' by the the two input sets of color points. Thus, if one of the volumes is entirely 
#' contained within the other, this overlap will be \code{vsmallest = 1}.
#'  \item \code{vboth} the volume of the overlap divided by the combined volume of both 
#' input sets of color points.
#' }
#' @note Stoddard & Stevens (2011) originally obtained the volume overlap through Monte Carlo
#' simulations of points within the range of the volumes, and obtaining the frequency of 
#' simulated values that fall inside the volumes defined by both sets of color points.
#' @note Here we present an exact solution based on finding common vertices to both volumes
#' and calculating its volume.
#'
#' @note Stoddard & Stevens (2011) also return the value of the overlap relative to one of
#' the volumes (in that case, the host species). However, for other applications
#' this value may not be what one expects to obtain if (1) the two 
#' volumes differ considerably in size, or (2) one of the volumes is entirely contained
#' within the other. For this reason, we also report the volume relative to the union of
#' the two input volumes, which may be more adequate in most cases.
