# Contributions welcome!

We are happy to discuss ideas, and suggest seeking feedback before spending significant time on a contribution. Take a look at current and past [issues](../../issues/) and [pull requests](../../pulls/) before adding something new, just to avoid duplicating efforts and conversations.

This project welcomes any kind of contribution. Possibilities include:

- **Ideas**: participate in an issue thread or start your own.
- **Copy editing**: fix typos, clarify language, and generally improve the quality of the content.
- **Formatting**: help keep content easy to read with consistent formatting.
- **Code**: help maintain and improve the project codebase.

### General guidelines

If you'd like to contribute changes directly, we suggest [the GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) for proposing, submitting, reviewing, and accepting changes. We also prefer R coding style that adheres to http://style.tidyverse.org/.

## Code of Conduct

We want to encourage a warm, welcoming, and safe environment for contributing to this project. See the [code of conduct](https://github.com/rmaia/pavo/blob/master/CONDUCT.md) for more information.
